    "1) **Interactive Match Simulation**: Allow users to make real-time decisions during match simulations, such as changing tactics, making substitutions, or giving motivational speeches. This would increase user engagement and make the matches feel more interactive and strategic.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Pros:\n",
    "   - Enhances user involvement and immersion in the game.\n",
    "   - Provides a sense of control and ownership over match outcomes.\n",
    "   - Increases replay value as users can experiment with different strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Cons:\n",
    "   - Requires additional development effort to implement interactive features.\n",
    "   - Could potentially overwhelm casual players with too many options.\n",
    "   - May lead to longer match simulation times, affecting overall game pacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2) **Match Simulation Enhancements**: Improve the realism and excitement of match simulations by adding dynamic commentary, visual effects, and crowd reactions. Introduce weather conditions, injuries, and other unpredictable elements to make matches more engaging.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Requires additional resources for developing new features and content.\n",
    "    - May increase the complexity of the game, making it harder for new players to understand.\n",
    "    - Could potentially lead to longer loading times and performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3) **Match Simulation Customization**: Allow users to customize match simulation settings, such as match speed, difficulty level, and frequency of interruptions. Provide options to skip simulations, automate decisions, or simulate specific match scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Provides flexibility and control to users, catering to different play styles and preferences.\n",
    "    - Allows users to tailor the match simulation experience to their liking.\n",
    "    - Increases accessibility for casual players who prefer faster-paced gameplay.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Requires additional development effort to implement customization options.\n",
    "    - May lead to feature fragmentation and complexity if not implemented properly.\n",
    "    - Could potentially reduce the challenge and excitement of matches if users opt for easier settings."
